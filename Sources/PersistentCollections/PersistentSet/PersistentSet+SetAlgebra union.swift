/// Returns a new set with the elements of both this and the given set.
///
///     var a: PersistentSet = [1, 2, 3, 4]
///     let b: PersistentSet = [0, 2, 4, 6]
///     let c = a.union(b)
///     // `c` is some permutation of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]`
///
/// For values that are members of both sets, the result set contains the
/// instances that were originally in `self`. (This matters if equal members
/// can be distinguished by comparing their identities, or by some other means.)
///
/// - Parameter other: The set of elements to insert.
/// - Complexity: Expected complexity is O(`self.count` + `other.count`) in
///     the worst case, if `Element` properly implements hashing.
///     However, the implementation is careful to make the best use of
///     hash tree structure to minimize work when possible, e.g. by linking
///     parts of the input trees directly into the result.
